## 📝 Project Overview

This project provides a Python script that automatically organizes files in a selected directory by sorting them into folders based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos, etc.). It’s perfect for decluttering downloads, desktop folders, or any other directory.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Automatically detect file types and sort them into predefined folders.
- Works with common file types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.mp4`, `.txt`, etc.).
- Easy to customize folder categories and file extensions.
- Includes a `demo files` folder for testing.
